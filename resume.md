## Work Experience

### GE Current
*September 2016 - Present*  
Senior Software Engineer

 - Was promoted to Senior Software Engineer after being recognized for my initiative to solve
   problems, mentoring my junior colleagues, and my ability to be in various roles at any given 
   time.
 - Designed and implemented a framework and tools for developing real time analytics ontop of Apache Spark. My
   goals were to allow others to be quicker to start and have less headaches as they developed their own
   batch or streaming analytics. I took inspiration from projects like Spring XD but wasn't satisified with their
   bloated approach. I had a clear focus on improving the unit testing side of things as well. 
   I aided in rewriting our aggregation, normalization, and rules engine to incorporate this framework.
 - Designed and implemented a service to aggregate metrics for billing the clients of our APIs using Apache Spark.
 - Worked with an acquired remote team in Australia to bring their IoT data into one of Current's existing products.
 - Continued mentoring my colleagues on an ad-hoc basis, giving them guidance when they asked questions, fuel to light
   their fires, and motivated them to question the unknown.
 
### GE Current
*September 2015 - Present*  
Software Engineer

 - Took an offer within GE Lighting to help form its new division, GE Current. More specifically I joined the 
   Intelligent Platforms Team, which focused more on IoT Sensor networks for cities and enterprises powered by Predix, 
   GE's cloud infrastructure.
 - Focused on learning and mastering Polymer, a library technology for building WebComponents using HTML5 and JavaScript.
   I worked closely with the Predix UI team to help them build reuseable WebComponents and develop a set of best practices
   for GE with regards to Polymer.
 - Learned the Microservices architecture atop CloudFoundry. Using Spring Boot and Spring MVC, we were able to design and 
   develop production grade APIs very quickly.
 - Took a firm stance on evangelizing unit testing and clean code. Gave several lectures to various teams in Current with
   agendas pertaining to TDD, unit testing, integration testing, refactoring (code smell detection) and maintainable codebases.
 - Took up learning Go and writing a system that routes realtime events to clients that have subscribed, given that the events
   meet the criteria that the subscribers are looking for. Utilized CSP heavily to organize each subsystem to allow for ease of
   testing and comprehension of the codebase. Gave lectures on Go to the team and sparked much interest in the technology.

 
### GE Lighting
*July 2013 - September 2015*  
Software Engineer

 - Worked as a member of a team developing and maintaining LightGrid, an IoT application dedicated to remote streelight control
   and energy savings.
 - Starting out as a junior, my role was more devoted to QA and testing the LightGrid Node, a photocel that uses RF Mesh to connect
   to a cloud backhaul.
 - Wrote the Functional Test Suite (FCT) for the LightGrid node, which was ran after nodes were manufactured to ensure that the node
   met quality standards.
 - Worked closely with other members of a QA team and delivered scripts and tools that enabled others to manage and control node
   networks easier.
 - Designed and implemented the "V2" version of LightGrid with a more standard REST API and AngularJS frontend. This removed the 
   previous JSF components that were a developmental headache and limited growth of the application.
 - Maintained large scale deployments of LightGrid on an around-the-clock basis until a support team could be hired and trained 
   with my documentation to take over this role.
   
### Case Western Reserve University  
*January 2013 - June 2013*  
Software Engineer Consultant  

  - Worked as a member of a small team that focused on delivering HD video and audio streams specifically targetting
    remote doctors and patients.
  - Using P2P connections, we were able to delivery HQ audio feeds that were losslessly compressed and ensured little interruption
    of the microphone feed and output. We acheived this by using Max/MSP and Raknet with C++ modules.
