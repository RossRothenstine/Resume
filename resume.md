## Work Experience

### GE Current
*September 2016 - Present*
Senior Software Engineer

 - Was promoted to Senior Software Engineer after being recognized for my initiative to solve
   problems, mentoring my junior colleagues, and my ability to be in various roles at any given 
   time.
 - Designed and implemented a framework and tools for developing real time analytics ontop of Apache Spark. My
   goals were to allow others to be quicker to start and have less headaches as they developed their own
   batch or streaming analytics. I took inspiration from projects like Spring XD but wasn't satisified with their
   bloated approach. I had a clear focus on improving the unit testing side of things as well. 
   I aided in rewriting our aggregation, normalization, and rules engine to incorporate this framework.
 - Designed and implemented a service to aggregate metrics for billing clients of our APIs using Apache Spark.
